# rubiks-cube
One of my first projects from 2012, an interactive rubik's cube visualizer and solver.
![alt text](https://github.com/zetez/rubiks-cube/blob/master/rubiks-cube.png?raw=true)
A simple program with lots of bugs, using OpenGL for drawing.
Perform moves using the key corresponding to a particular face.
Move the camera by holding down the mouse button while moving the mouse.
Solve the cube using the CFOP algorithm by pressing **O**.
Press **X** to close.
